IMPORTANT:
On April 19th at 9:04 PM, Nintendo copyright claimed both of my KMG2 trailer videos. I'm putting this here
as a warning for anyone who might want to make a video on this hack. As much as I would still love to see
content, I don't want to put anyone's channel in danger. Create at your own risk! (It's probably fine.)
Also I have decided to remove ISO builder support in favor of dolphin's new riivolution patch support.

Instructions (Wii):
-Put the "KMGR" folder in the root of your SD card.
-Put the "riivolution" folder on the root of your SD card.
-Boot up Riivolution, and select your region.
-Have fun!

Instructions (Dolphin):
-Extract "KaizoMarioGalaxyRebalancedV2.1" to preferred location. (Keep both folders inside together.)
-Download Dolphin v5.0-15445 (Recommended) or higher. https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-15445/
-Set Dolphin's game directory.
-Right click Super Mario Galaxy.
-Select "Start With Riivolution Patches."
-Click "Open Riivolution XML."
-Navigate to "KMGR.xml" inside "\KaizoMarioGalaxyRebalanced\riivolution" and open it.
-Choose your region with the dropdown box. (Using the wrong region could cause things to break or crash.)
-Press Start.
-Have Fun!

Notes:
-This hack supports 4 languages! English, UsSpanish, EuSpanish, and German!
-This hack has 120 stars. Grand Finale Galaxy as of right now still hasn't been modified.
(I barely had enough time to get this out, making a fully custom level is off the table at the moment.)
-KOR custom codes have not all been fully tested as of Nov. 30, 2023.
